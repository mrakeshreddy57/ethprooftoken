# MyToken
This Solidity program is a assessment program that deploy on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates basic functionalities of a cryptocurrency token, which includes declaring, mininting and burning tokens and also with the basic safety checks.

## Description
MyToken contracts is the baisc cryptocurrency token contracts that has been deployed on the Ethereum. It allows user to create a simple token with specific name, abbreviation nad total supply. Includes public variables for storing the token details, mapping the address of balances to its values and fucntion for mint and burn the token. Mint function increases the total supply and the balances of a specified address, while burn function decreases the total supply and the balances of the specified address with a check to ensure suffient balance.
